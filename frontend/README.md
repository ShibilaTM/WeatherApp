# MERN
Since I finished developing the Mern Stack during training, I am more familiar with react.js than vue.js. Therefore, I utilized react.js for the front end and node.js and express.js for the server side, with mongodb being used as the database.Since I am more experienced with CSS, I used it for styling. I attempted to use Tailwind CSS, but the time constraints made it more challenging for me.

# Email
I usually use Nodemailer to send emails, but right now it's not working because of the three-day deadline. I'll finish the task as follows.
